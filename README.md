# 📥 Queue Implementation (OOP C++)

A console-based Queue data structure implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project builds a FIFO (First-In First-Out) queue by composing a custom Doubly Linked List, without using any STL containers.

# 📌 Features
# 🧱 Internal Structure

Queue is implemented using a Doubly Linked List

No STL containers (queue, list, vector) are used

Fully template-based for reusability with any data type

# ➕ Insertion Operations (Enqueue)

Push element to the back of the queue

Insert at front

Insert at back

Insert after a specific index

# ❌ Removal Operations (Dequeue)

Remove element from the front (FIFO behavior)

Clear the entire queue

# 🔍 Access Operations

Get front element

Get back element

Get item by index

Update item by index

# 🔄 Queue Utilities

Reverse the queue

Check if queue is empty

Get current queue size

Print queue contents in order

# 🖥️ Console Output

Clear and readable output of queue contents, for example:
```
1  2  3  4  5
```

All operations are tested step-by-step through a console-based driver program.

# 🧠 Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Templates (template <class T>)

Composition (Queue built using Linked List)

Pointers and references

Encapsulation

Core Data Structures (Queue & Linked List)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

C++

Console-based application

Custom data structures (no STL)

# 🎯 Educational Purpose

This project is designed to:

Understand how queues work internally

Practice FIFO logic using linked lists

Apply composition in OOP design

Strengthen pointer and memory management skills

Build a solid foundation for stacks, deques, and advanced data structures

Prepare for technical interviews
